Repository-backed Agent Skills for the [Kujo programming language](https://kujolang.ai) and its ecosystem tools.

The catalog gives coding agents exact Kujo commands, safety boundaries, validation gates, and source-of-truth paths. It covers everyday `.kujo` development, the Rust runtime, the complete Publishing House editorial toolchain, and focused ecosystem workflows.

## Why use this pack?

- Route work to 135 focused skills, including the cross-cutting `kujo-way-development` baseline, 30 WebOps skills, the VideoOps team operator plus 36 production skills, two reusable video production presets, and 11 Publishing House tool, profile, quality, and lifecycle skills.
- Keep VM-first execution, capability boundaries, and CLI contracts explicit.
- Ground recommendations in Kujo repositories, tests, and operational docs.
- Validate the complete catalog offline with one command.
- Install only the skills an agent actually needs.

## Quick start

Clone and validate the pack:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kujolang/kujo-skills.git
cd kujo-skills
bash tests/release-readiness.sh
```

Install one skill into a personal Codex skill directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R skills/kujo-core-language ~/.codex/skills/
```

Then ask Codex to use it:

```text
Use $kujo-core-language to review this .kujo script for current syntax and VM-first execution.
```

Other Agent Skills-compatible runtimes may use a different skill directory. Copy the complete skill folder, including `SKILL.md` and any `agents/` metadata.

## Find the right skill

Start with the [skill catalog](SKILLS_INDEX.md). Common entry points include:

| Goal | Skill |
|---|---|
| Build or substantially review a Kujo project in the Kujo Way | `kujo-way-development` |
| Write or review Kujo source | `kujo-core-language` |
| Build a deterministic Kujo CLI tool | `kujo-tool-building` |
| Review capability and host-effect safety | `kujo-security-hardening` |
| Run release-readiness checks | `kujo-shipcheck-workflows` |
| Release a Kujo project and synchronize its public web presence | `kujo-ecosystem-launch` |
| Detect documentation or artifact drift | `kujo-concord-workflows` |
| Run isolated local workflow proof | `kujo-workcell-workflows` |
| Audit or refresh this skills pack | `kujo-skill-auditor` |
| Crawl and compare a website | `kujo-siteprobe-workflows` |
| Normalize search/analytics/provider evidence | `kujo-searchbridge-workflows` |
| Build deterministic content relationships | `kujo-contentgraph-workflows` |
| Make the fixed trust-at-speed release film | `kujo-release-video` |
| Choose one of ten video styles and its narrator | `kujo-video-styles` |
| Produce a complete video through the VideoOps team | `kujo-videoops-workflows` |
| Execute authorized speech, sound effects, music or local import | `videoops-media-provider-execution` |
| Run a WebOps methodology | the narrowest `webops-*` skill |
| Run the Publishing House lifecycle | `kujo-publishing-house-workflows` |
| Operate a Publishing House tool | the narrowest tool-specific workflow skill |

## Release and support status

This repository is the MIT-licensed `0.7.0` technical preview of the Kujo skills pack. Kujo `v1.0.2` is the current stable language/runtime baseline for the Publishing House toolchain; individual skills preserve explicit preview or experimental boundaries for narrower APIs.

The `0.7.0` release adds two reusable video skills: the fixed trust-at-speed
release preset and ten launch/video styles with per-style ElevenLabs narrator
defaults and caller overrides. The 135-skill catalog includes isolated installation
and compiler regression checks. VideoOps media guidance points to the canonical
`kujo-agents/videoops/tools` runtime; HyperFrames retains composition and mixing
ownership.

Use [`videoops-media-provider-execution`](skills/videoops-media-provider-execution/SKILL.md)
with `kujo-agents/videoops/tools/bin/videoops` rather than copying a production-specific provider
script. Implementation and mocked coverage do not imply account entitlement or
live verification of every capability; actual live outcomes and usage belong
in the runtime's per-request receipts. Voice, brand and glitch choices remain
production presets. The migrated `kujo-release-video` and `kujo-video-styles` folders own
those reusable presets; finished productions remain in `kujo-hyperframes`. Install
both video skill folders together to include their shared assets. See the
[video migration and integration notes](docs/video-skills-migration.md). No live-profile installation is needed to validate this pack.

The pack provides guidance, not runtime enforcement. An agent or host must load a skill and enforce its own permissions. Kujo itself is not a sandbox: use `--untrusted`, least-privilege `--allow-*` flags, and external isolation for high-risk scripts.

Marketplace publication, automatic installation into live profiles, and claims that third-party agents will obey these skills remain outside this repository's evidence boundary.
